Hi, this is Hao Cui, from [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/).

I'm now pursuing my master's degree of Computer Science, and I achieved my bachelor's degree at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/), China, majoring in Software Engineering.

My main focus is software development, including apps and websites. I have participated in as well as led many projects during my undergraduate study. I can skifully use Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python and frameworks like Spring, Angular, Node.js and Django. Among them, Java is my favourite.
