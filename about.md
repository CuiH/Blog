Hi, this is Hao Cui, from [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/).

I'm now pursuing my master's degree of Computer Science, and I achieved my bachelor's degree at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/), China, majoring in Software Engineering.

My main focus is software development, including apps and websites. I have participated in / led many projects during my undergraduate study. I can skifully use Java/C++/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Python and frameworks like Spring/Angular/Node.js/Django. Among them, Java is my favourite.

You can also use the links in the navigation bar ([home page](/)) to know more about me.
