Hi, this is Hao Cui. Nice to meet you.

I'm now pursuing my master's degree of Software Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I got my bachelor's degree at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/), China, majoring in Software Engineering.

My main focus is software development. I have participated in as well as led many software projects, including web apps, android apps and 2D games. I can skillfully use Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C++, Python and frameworks like React, Angular, Express, Koa, Spring, Play and Django. Among them, Java is my favorite.
